steel shapeoko2
===============

Big Shapeoko made by steel tubes and OpenRail.

In my country isn't easy to amateur materials like openslide or other aluminium railed frames. If you buy something like shapeoko or makerslide to the USA, you have to pay a lot of clearance costs.

I've tied made an opensource big CNC, ussing the existing projects as Shapeoko and RepRap.
